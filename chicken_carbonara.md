% Chicken Carbonara

# Ingredients

- 2 Boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized strips
- 12-14 oz Linguine
- 4 strips Thick-cut bacon
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced

### Carbonara Sauce

- 4 Eggs
- 3/4 cup Grated parmesan cheese
- 1/3 cup Heavy cream
- 1/4 cup Chopped fresh basil (plus more for garnish)

# Method

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook linguine al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before straining.

2. Combine eggs, cream, Parmesan cheese, basil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk thoroughly and set aside.

3. Chop bacon into 1/2 inch pieces. Cook in a cast iron skillet on medium heat until fully cooked, remove from the skillet and place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Keep 1-2 tablespoons of bacon grease in the skillet and discard the rest.

4. Add minced garlic and sliced chicken (bite-sized) to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper and cook until chicken is fully cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.

5. Return bacon to the skillet, add the warm linguine and toss with chicken and bacon. Turn the burner down to low and let the skillet cool for 2-3 minutes. If the skillet is too hot you run the risk of scrambling the eggs.

6. Add egg mixture to the skillet and toss with the pasta until fully incorporated. Stir in 2-3 tablespoons of reserved pasta water until creamy. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil.
