% French Baguettes

# Ingredients

- 700g flour
- 520g tap water
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp dried yeast

# Method

1. Mix flour, yeast, salt.

2. Add water, bring together to a sticky dough.

3. Cover bowl and let rest for _four_ **45 minute** periods. Between each period knock the dough back (for a total of _three_ times). Make sure to wet your hands and wipe down the counter with a damp cloth before knocking back the dough.

4. Divide the dough into _four_ equal pieces on a well floured surface, and remove all the bubbles from them (see the video linked bellow for a demonstration). Pre-shape the dough into balls, cover them in flowered plastic wrap, and let them relax for **15 minutes**.

5. Remove the bubbles again and form the dough into baguettes. Place the baguettes on a flowered dish towel, cover them, and wait for **20 minutes**.

6. Pre-heat the oven for **420&deg; F** with a tray of water on the bottom shelf. Move the baguettes onto baking trays, mist with water, and score the baguettes. Bake for **20 minutes** or until brown. Turn the trays around half way through and re-mist the oven.

7. Let cool on a wire rack.
