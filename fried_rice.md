1. In a pan over high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and cook your protein, adding 1 tbsp of garlic butter for additional flavor. Remove and set aside.

2. In the same pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil and fry your garlic for 15 seconds followed by your carrots, onions, and scallions for 1-2 minutes. Add your rice and continue frying, separating and combining until relatively dry (2-3 minutes).

3. Push the rice to the side and add 1 tbsp of oil, then fry 2 eggs and cook until 90% done. Mix into the rice. Season with light soy sauce, white pepper, sugar, salt, MSG, and 2 tbsp of garlic butter. Mix and fry for 1-2 more minutes.
